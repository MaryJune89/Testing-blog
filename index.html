        <p> I worked in the social work field for several years. I was always one to provide individuals with the tools 
          they needed to improve their quality of life. I provided resources, linked to services, the whole nine.
          I went to graduate school for social work in 2019. 2020 came and the COVID-19 pandemic shifted all work to be from home.
          I finished my graduate degree but my view began to shift in terms of how services are provided to communities. 
          Social work quickly became overwhelmed due to illnesses, deaths, the effects of job loss in communities, and much more. The main 
         thing that stood out to me was the lack of resources for seniors and the gap in their ability to work
         with technology. Things like finding a caregiver became almost like trying to find a needle in a haystack. I began to look into 
         tools that can be user-friendly for seniors/caregivers to use to find the care they need. Some 
         exist out there but I started looking into building a tool for a caregiver to locate home health agencies in 
         their local area that was familiar to them. It lead me down a path of numerous resources & so I began to build.
         I learned how to create websites & contributed to open source projects and started from there. I then began to work on this app 
         that can help caregivers locate home health care near them. I went deeper and deeper into Software Engineering and as I did so, this switch went off and I suddenly felt 
        like this is the path for me. From learning the tools like VS Code, Github, and Git and how to create a domain. I volunteered with local organizations 
        and worked in teams helping create user-friendly sites. It all felt very nostalgic and I developed a passion for coding 
        and providing a way to possibly bridge a gap between communities & technology and how it can be smoothly integrated within the daily lives of people of all ages. </p>


        <p> I loved the process of solving complex problems, consistently building new programming skills in addition to creating content that was
            easy for users to access.
            I discovered a community that was more than willing to help me throughout my learning process. I would have
            never discovered all this, had I not taken that leap of faith. If you have been thinking on beginning your
            path, do not wait! <b><i>Start now!</i></b>
