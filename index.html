        <p> In my 30s, I decided that social work was no longer for me. I had reached my peak in the field. I realized
            about mid way through studying for my LISW that I did not want to be a therapist or counselor. I felt
            stagnant and I was not happy in the role that I was in. It just wasn't challenging enough & the workload
            heavily outweighed the pay.</p>

        <p>During the COVID-19 Pandemic, I had been moved to work remote. I also had my second child during that time
            and that marked a huge change in my life. I knew that my life was in for a shift and things would not be the
            same. I also decided that if I can, I want to continue to work from home or hybrid. I enjoyed the
            flexibility and time I was able to spend with my family. So, I decided to embark on the path to become a
            Software Engineer. </p>

        <p>As I began to research ways to become a Software Engineer, I decided to dive into coding. I enrolled in a
            free boot camp and decided discovered that my interests were in Frontend Web Development.
            Throughout my path, I started to work on small projects as I was learning, including this very blog that
            you're reading. I loved the process of solving complex problems in addition to creating content that was
            easy for users to access.
            I discovered a community that was more than willing to help me throughout my learning process. I would have
            never discovered all this, had I not taken that leap of faith. If you have been thinking on beginning your
            path, do not wait! <b><i>Start now!</i></b>
